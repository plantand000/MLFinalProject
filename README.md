# In Hosptial Mortality Rate Prediction Model
This repo contains a machine learning pipeline that predictions in the mortality rate of in hospital patients. This particular model had an accuracy of 93.45%.

Dataset:
The dataset is a subset of the eICU data. You will be predicting in-hospital mortality (binary classification task predicting whether a patient will expire during their hospital stay). You can find a more detailed description of the data in the "Data" tab above.

Modeling:
You have to create a model that predicts the probability of in-hospital mortality given the input data. There are no requirements for the type of model you use. We have provided template code for you to begin with. You should start here and are expected to meet the function requirements provided so that your solution can be submitted onto our Kaggle competition. You are looking to beat my AUC-ROC score. You can view it on the Leaderboard tab above. The submission to beat is "Ryan's Submission." If you beat my submission and we can reproduce your results using your saved model, you will receive full credit for the model performance section.

Report Writing:
In addition to your code you will write a conference-style report. This written report will follow the template provided on canvas. You will be required, in latex, to write a full description of the problem being studied, important references you found helpful in developing your submission, and a clear description of your implementation and experimentation - aside from the KAGGLE results, this description is how you provide confidence that you believe you implemented the model with high accuracy and that it will perform generally across any held out test set we apply it to.
